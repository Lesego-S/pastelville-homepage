Hometown Homepage Project

Project Overview

This is a solo project created as part of my Frontend Development Career Path course at Scrimba. After completing the basic HTML and CSS introduction section, this project allowed me to practice applying foundational web development skills, including Flexbox, class usage, and design principles.
